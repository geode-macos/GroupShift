# GroupShift

This mod adds a simple utility to the editor that makes it really easy to copy+paste large amounts of repetitive triggers! It works by <cj>SHIFTING</c> the groups of all selected objects/triggers by either adding or subtracting a specified amount, making once repetitive tasks go by extremely quickly! This mod was developed for a personal project and its use cases are very niche, but I found it very useful so I hope someone else can benefit from its functionality!

## Usage

To change the selected objects' groups, press the <cj>SHIFT</c> button in the Edit Group screen, or click the "Add Group ID" label above the input field. This mod also lets you <cj>SHIFT</c> any property of the selected triggers, such as the target group of a Move trigger or the count of a Pickup trigger. Just click the label of the property you want to <cj>SHIFT</c> to open the popup!

## Supported Triggers

 * Spawn
 * Pickup
 * Instant Count
 * Instant Collision
 * Item Edit
 * Item Compare
 * Collision Block
 * Item Label

## Request Features

Please create an issue on the mod's [GitHub](https://github.com/glow13/GroupShift) page if you want to request another feature or support for another trigger that I haven't implemented yet, and I will try to add it in the next update!
